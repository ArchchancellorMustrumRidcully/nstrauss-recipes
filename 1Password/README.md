# 1Password
`preinstall.sh` will remove 1Password 7 installations. It is included by default in the Munki recipe. It is not in the .pkg recipe with the goal of keeping it as vanilla as possible. The script can be included in a Jamf policy or similar depending on your management solution before installing 1Password 8.
