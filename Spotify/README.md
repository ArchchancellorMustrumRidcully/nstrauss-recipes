# Spotify recipe
Spotify doesn't use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A typical version string looks like `1.2.8.923.g4f94bf0d` or `1.2.8.923.g4f94bf0d-1547`. This recipe is a fork of the [one in the main AutoPkg repo](https://github.com/autopkg/recipes/blob/master/Spotify/Spotify.munki.recipe) with the only difference being the version is normalized using Elliot Jordan's [`VersionSplitter` processor](https://github.com/autopkg/homebysix-recipes/blob/master/VersionSplitter/VersionSplitter.py). The resulting version is split to something like `1.2.8.923`, which can then be used with most version comparison libraries.
